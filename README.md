# Countdown Timer
This is a simple webpage for a countdown for any date. The user would enter/select a date and click the Start Timer button. The timer shows the remaining time in days, hours, minutes and seconds. The countdown would be till 12:00 am of the selected date. Currently the timer is for Pakistan (UTC+05:00), but can be changed to any time zone by slightly modifying the code in script part of html (comment added).
